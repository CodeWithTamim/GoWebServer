## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeWithTamim/GoWebServer.git
cd GoWebServer
```

### Running the Server

To run the server, simply execute:

```bash
go run main.go
```

By default, the server will start on `localhost:8080`. You can then access your static files by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Customizing Port

If you want to run the server on a different port, modify the `main.go` file as follows:

```go
http.ListenAndServe(":YOUR_PORT", nil)
```
